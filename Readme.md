##Contributing


- **Currently, the system uses in-memory data structures. To retain data between sessions, integrate a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL).
Password Security:

- **Passwords are hashed using SHA-256, which is secure for demonstration purposes. For enhanced security, consider using more robust hashing algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2.
User Interface:

- **The system uses a CLI for simplicity. Developing a graphical user interface (GUI) or a web-based interface can improve user experience.
